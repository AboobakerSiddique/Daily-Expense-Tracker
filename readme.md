# 💰 Daily Expense Tracker

## 📖 Project Overview
The **Daily Expense Tracker** is a command-line Python application that helps users record and manage their daily expenses. It allows users to add expenses, view all recorded expenses, calculate the total amount spent, search for specific expenses, delete expenses, and keep track of the total number of recorded expenses. All data is stored permanently in a text file so that expenses are available even after the program is closed.

## 📁 Expense Storage Format

Each expense is stored in the following format:

```
Date | Expense Name | Amount
```

Example:

```
2026-07-12 08:30:12|Chicken|330
2026-07-12 09:10:45|Petrol|500
2026-07-12 10:20:31|Coffee|80
```
